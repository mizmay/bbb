# Mapping the Big Beautiful Bill

I recently read that most Americans are not following the Big Beautiful Bill and are not aware of its contents. Among other things, it is projected to:
- Add $3-5 trillion to the Federal budget deficit (depending who you ask)
- Cut taxes for the wealthiest 20% of Americans at the expense of the poorest 20% of Americans
- Sharply reduce the number of medicaid recipients by placing onerous qualifiction and paperwork requirements on those already least able to handle these things
- Cuts all funding for programs to create domestic industries for renewable energy technology, make electric cars affordable, and incentivize home improvements for energy efficiency

It is difficult for me to understand why anyone would be in favor of this measure, yet it is poised to be ratified into law, after a torturous journey through the House and Senate.

For wont of logic, I am turning to data. Feel free to fork and contribute, or share your thoughts.
